# ClearPaws

ClearPaws is an AI-powered pet travel compliance planner for Australia. Pet owners enter three things — where they are moving from, when they want to travel, and what pet they have — and receive a personalised step-by-step DAFF compliance timeline with exact dates, real cost estimates, and every requirement written in plain English. The product runs across four phases: a free timeline generator, paid accounts and document packs, a subscription tier with premium features, and a B2B white-label platform for pet transport agencies.

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier is fine)
- An [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) API key
- A [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account in test mode
- A [Resend](https://resend.com) account

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/clearpaws.git
cd clearpaws
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and fill in every value. The file has comments explaining where to find each one. All variables are required for full functionality — see the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section below.

### 3. Apply database migrations

Open the Supabase dashboard for your project, go to the SQL Editor, and run each migration file in order:

```
supabase/migrations/001_phase2_schema.sql
supabase/migrations/002_phase3_schema.sql
supabase/migrations/003_phase4_schema.sql
supabase/migrations/004_daff_monitoring.sql
```

Alternatively, with the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase db push
```

### 4. Configure Supabase Auth

In your Supabase dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:

- **Site URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Redirect URLs:** add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

To enable Google OAuth: Authentication → Providers → Google → enable and add your Client ID and Secret from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

Tests live in `__tests__/` and are organised to mirror the source structure. Coverage thresholds are set to 80% lines, functions, and branches in `vitest.config.ts`. Key test files:

- `__tests__/lib/daff-rules.test.ts` — regression guards for DAFF compliance rules (rnattWaitDays, quarantine days, breed bans)
- `__tests__/lib/timeline-schema.test.ts` — Zod validation for timeline input/output
- `__tests__/api/` — API route tests using mock Supabase clients

---

## Deploying

### Vercel (recommended)

1. Push to the `main` branch — Vercel deploys automatically.
2. Add all environment variables in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables.
3. Set Stripe webhook endpoint to `https://clearpaws.com.au/api/webhook/stripe` — copy the signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
4. Vercel activates the cron jobs in `vercel.json` automatically in production.

### Manual production build

```bash
npm run build   # must pass before pushing
npm run start   # preview production build locally
```

### Cron jobs

Configured in `vercel.json` and secured by `CRON_SECRET`:

| Endpoint | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/cron/reminders` | Daily 9am UTC | Emails users whose compliance steps are due within 14 days |
| `/api/cron/daff-scrape` | Sunday 11pm UTC | Scrapes DAFF pages, detects content changes, emails admin alert |

## Phase summary

### Phase 1 — Timeline generator
Free tool at `/generate`. Three-step form collects origin country, travel date, and pet details. Submits to `POST /api/generate-timeline` which validates input with Zod, injects the full DAFF rule set from `daff-rules.ts` as context, calls the Claude API, and returns a structured compliance timeline. Rate limited to 5 requests per IP per day. No account required.

### Phase 2 — Accounts and payments
Supabase Auth with email/password and Google OAuth. Users can save generated timelines to their account. A one-time $49 AUD Stripe payment unlocks a professional PDF document pack generated server-side with `@react-pdf/renderer`. Stripe webhook at `/api/webhook/stripe` writes purchase records after signature verification. Resend sends deadline reminder emails via a daily Vercel cron job.

### Phase 3 — Subscription and premium features
$9.90 AUD/month Stripe subscription gives users a progress tracker to tick off completed steps, multi-pet profile management, a map of DAFF-approved export vets filtered by state, a directory of RNATT-approved laboratories by country, and a comparison table of Petraveller, Dogtainers, and Jetpets with pricing and direct referral links.

### Phase 4 — B2B white-label platform
Pet transport agencies pay $299 AUD/month for a white-label portal (`[slug].clearpaws.com.au`) where their customers use the timeline tool under the agency's branding. Agencies log in to `agency.clearpaws.com.au` to view leads, update statuses, export CSV, and manage API keys. A public REST API (`/api/v1`) allows agencies to integrate the timeline engine programmatically. Vets can register at `vet.clearpaws.com.au` and manage export clients. An admin dashboard tracks MRR, user growth, referral clicks, and API usage.

## Accuracy system

DAFF compliance information must be correct. ClearPaws uses three layers:

**Layer 1 — Hardcoded knowledge base**
All stable DAFF rules are stored in `src/lib/daff-rules.ts` with source URLs and verified dates. The Claude API is never asked to recall rules from training data. Every call to the AI includes the full rule set explicitly: *"Here are the current DAFF rules. Use only these rules. Do not add rules not listed here."*

**Layer 2 — Weekly monitoring**
`GET /api/cron/daff-scrape` runs every Sunday. It fetches the official DAFF pages, hashes the content, compares against the previous snapshot in the `daff_snapshots` table, and emails the admin if any page has changed. No rule change goes live without human review.

**Layer 3 — Live data**
Mickleham Post Entry Quarantine Facility availability is fetched at query time from the DAFF website and cached for 24 hours with a stale fallback.

## Security notes

- All API routes validate requests with Zod before any database or AI operation
- Stripe webhook signature is verified on every request before writing to the database
- API keys are bcrypt-hashed before storage — the raw key is shown once on creation and never stored
- Supabase Row Level Security is enabled on all tables — users can only read and write their own rows
- The Claude API key, Stripe secret key, and Supabase service role key are server-side only and never exposed to the browser
- Cron endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` to prevent unauthorised invocations
- Origin validation on Stripe checkout routes prevents open-redirect attacks via crafted headers
